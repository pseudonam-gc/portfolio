### Introduction

This is just a personal portfolio featuring various mathematical, coding, or game design related projects. 

The projects are as follows:

## Detecting Human Bias With Neural Networks

Is it possible to use neural networks to solve the classical problem of distinguishing a truly random sequence of coinflips from a human-created fake? Includes an interactive web application made under hackathon constraints.

## Goofspiel Solver

My attempt to solve the Game of Pure Strategy (which ought to be renamed Game of Pure Psychology). The implementation uses recursion, linear programming, and memoization, and is multiple times shorter (and more readable) than many other attempts to solve the game.

## Genius Game 4

Rulesets and various code for my first Online Reality Game (inspired by The Genius) that I hosted. The Main Matches (my primary contribution to the ORG) are listed here.
