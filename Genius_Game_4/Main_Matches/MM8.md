# **Main Match 8: Painting Game**

*Help Pseudonam multitask his modern art homework with GG4 by creating a collective masterpiece!*

### **Summary**

Buy sheets from the auction, then recreate them on the larger grid by placing colors! 

### **Setup**

The game will be played on a 5x5 square grid. At the start, every space on the grid is white.

At the beginning of the game, each square on the grid will start colored white.

### **Gameplay**

There are six rounds in this MM, 24 hours each. In each round, players will both bid for sheets and splash colors onto the grid.

Players are given 30 bidding tokens and gain 10 each bidding round. These carry over onto later rounds. 

A sheet is a connected series of squares with each square containing a specific non-white color (red, blue, yellow, purple, green, or orange). Each sheet is identified with a different integer ID, and will be able to fit in a 4x4 square. In the bidding round, for each sheet, players can bid any amount to attempt to purchase it. Each sheet starts off with a score value of n+r, where n is the number of squares on the sheet and r is the round number -- for example, a sheet with 5 squares on Round 3 has a score value of 8. 

The first round will have ten sheets available. All future rounds will have seven sheets available. 
If a player has the highest bid on a sheet, that player loses that amount in bidding tokens and gains the sheet. If a player does not have the highest bid on a sheet, that player does not pay and does not gain the sheet. If there is a tie, nobody pays and the sheet is discarded. It is possible to have multiple sheets. All sheets gained are public.

Players cannot bid more bidding tokens overall than they have.

Each player can add a primary color (red, blue, yellow) to a single square on the grid. That square, and orthogonally adjacent squares, will have that color added. Once all players have added colors to their given squares, the following will occur:

The final color of a square is determined by the primary colors already on it and all primary colors added that round. If a primary color that is added is already on that square, nothing happens, and if a primary color is added multiple times in one round, the square is treated as if that primary color was added only once.

If a square only has one primary color on it, it stays that primary color.

If a square has two primary colors on it, it becomes the combination of the two. Red and blue make purple, red and yellow make orange, and blue and yellow make green.

If a square ever consists of all three primary colors, it becomes white, and all the primary colors on it will be reset for the next round.

If there is a series of squares on the grid that matches a series of squares on a sheet (it cannot be rotated nor reflected), the owner of the goal sheet scores as many points as the score value of the sheet, and the goal sheet is discarded. 

All remaining goal sheets continue into the next round, losing one score value in the process (minimum of 1). 

### **Results**

At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins Two Tokens of Life, ties being broken by bidding tokens remaining. If there is a further tie, all tied players receive a Token of Life, provided there are exactly two of them.

Players earn a garnet for every 20 points they have.

### **Garnets/Items**

One garnet can be converted into one bidding token at any time.
Five garnets can be used to submit another space and another color, and this will count as an extra submission. You can only do this once per MM.

### **Submissions**

Submit the numbers that correspond to any amount of sheets, and how much you are bidding for them. During the replacement round, submit a space and a color.

You have 24 hours to submit.
