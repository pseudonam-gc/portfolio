# **Main Match 2: Mini-Survivor**

*Face off against other players in a Survivor™ simulation with some of the Survivor™ series’ best known gimmicks: voting, tribe swapping, idols, and assassination!*

### **Setup**

Each player will control five Survivors. Each of the 60 Survivors is given a distinct ID, selected from the positive integers from 1-60. These numbers will be distributed randomly, and players will not know which Survivor is controlled by which player.

There will be twelve Tribes in this game (named a distinct letter from A-L), with five Survivors in each of them. These are arranged in a 3x4 grid as shown below. Each Survivor will be placed in a Tribe randomly, but under the condition that no player will have two Survivors in the same Tribe. Before the game begins, players will have 24 hours to read the rules. 

Each player also begins the game with an Idol, which they can use once throughout the whole game.

### **Gameplay**

This game is played in 24-hour rounds, which repeat until the game ends. Before each round begins, each player will learn the IDs of the Survivors in every Tribe. 

There are three segments in each round: Assassination, Voting, and Movement. Each player submits for all three in a single round. The results of each segment will be revealed post segment. It will be known which player controls a Survivor if that Survivor gets eliminated by one means or another.

### **Assassination Segment**

In this segment, each Survivor can assassinate one other Survivor in the same tribe if the player thinks he/she knows who the target is controlled by. Players can choose a Survivor they control to attack with, a Survivor to target by ID, and another player’s name. If that player controls the target’s Survivor, that Survivor is eliminated. However, if that player does not control that target’s Survivor, the attacking Survivor gets eliminated instead. 

All eliminations process at the same time. Assassinating is not a mandatory action. 

Every player will see which Survivors get assassinated in each Tribe, but not by which Survivor. Players may assassinate their own Survivors with other Survivors they own (a Survivor cannot assassinate itself).

### **Voting Segment**

In this segment, each Survivor in the Tribe must vote for another Survivor in the tribe by ID. This is a mandatory action; if any Survivor does not have an action, that Survivor will vote for itself. If a Survivor was eliminated in the Assassination Segment, its vote will not be counted, and neither will any votes for them. 

After that, the Survivor in the Tribe with the most votes is eliminated. If there is a tie for the most votes in a given Tribe, **all tied Survivors in the Tribe are eliminated**, even if there are no votes cast on any living Survivors in the Tribe (meaning all Survivors would be eliminated).
 
Every player will know the total vote count of each Tribe at the end of each round, but not the individual votes by the Survivors.

An idol can be used to grant a Survivor immunity. All votes on that Survivor not cast by that Survivor will be turned into self-votes. Players can use three garnets to give a Survivor an extra idol.

### **Movement Segment**

Players can also choose to move Survivors they control to an adjacent Tribe. Movement is not mandatory. If there are no adjacent Tribes, Survivors can move to any Tribe. If the Survivor does not get eliminated that round, that Survivor will move to the given Tribe before the next round begins. 

At the end of the three Segments, if there is now a Tribe with two or less Survivors, that Tribe is removed. Each of the Survivors of that Tribe are now Outcasts. This means that they are safe for that round and do not belong to a Tribe. but must move to another Tribe for the next round. In this case, those Survivors are allowed to move to any Tribe, not just adjacent Tribes. 

In the case that all remaining Tribes would be removed in the same round but the game hasn’t ended, one of the Tribes would be removed at random, and the other Tribes would remain. Members of the removed Tribe would be Outcasts for the next round. 

### **Scoring**

Once there are five or less Survivors in the game at the end of a Round, the game ends. All players will get one Token of Life per remaining Survivor. In the first round where 25 or less Survivors remained, all players will get one garnet per alive Survivor, but these garnets will be given at the end of the game. 

The Elimination Candidate is the player who had all their Survivors eliminated first. If there is a tie, the players who earned Tokens of Life will decide the EC. 

### **Garnets/Items**

Garnets can be used to gain an additional idol, which could be used the round that it is purchased. 

### **Submissions**

For each of your remaining Survivors:
Assassinate another Survivor in the same Tribe via ID and state which player you believe that Survivor belongs to. This is optional.
Submit a vote on a Survivor in the same Tribe via ID.
Move that Survivor to an adjacent Tribe, or any Tribe if there are no adjacent Tribes. This is optional. 
If any of your Survivors are Outcasts, you can only move them to another Tribe.
If you wish to use an Idol, specify which Survivor to play it on. 
Make sure to specify which Survivor does which action.
