# **Main Match 5: Blackout Middle Horse Race**

*Are you ready for another race? This one will be in the dark, though...*

### **Setup**

In Main Match 5, 9 horses labeled from A-I will be racing on a 15-space long track. Each horse begins on space 1; when a horse moves past space 15, it finishes the race and exits the track. Each player begins with 30 **chips** to bet on the horses. The positions of the horses are **not** made public. Each player also begins with 9 **horse cards**, one for each horse and labeled with the corresponding letter.

The Main Match will be played over 10 rounds; the game does not end early even if all horses have exited the track. There is also a Round 0 phase, during which no horses move.

### **Gameplay**

For each round, each horse has a **movement value** of either 1, 2, or 3; this is the number of spaces the horse will move at the end of the round.

Players can use **horse cards** to gain information about the horses. During each round, players may choose to use either that round’s **Clue Ability** or **Utility Ability**. Clue abilities will revolve around the movement of the horses, while utility abilities can do a variety of other things that may be useful. The exact abilities vary depending on what round it is; these are detailed in the **Abilities** section. 

Players may trade horse cards with each other, but only at a 1 to 1 ratio, and must do so in their pair chats. If both players accept, the deal will be resolved instantaneously.

Players can view horses’ positions by **spectating** spaces. During each round, players may choose a space to spectate for the next round. At the beginning of the next round, players who spectated a space will learn which horses, if any, are on that space. The space a player spectated in the previous round is known as their **current space**.

Players can also **bet** up to 5 chips per round on horses in their current space, distributed however they wish. At the end of the game, each chip bet on a horse scores a certain number of points depending on that horse’s placement (detailed in the **Scoring** section). All bets are private.

It is publicly announced when a horse exits the track, and in what place. Additionally, when a horse exits the track, all of its natural movement for future rounds is publicized. It is also publicly announced which players spectated which spaces.

### **Scoring**

Each chip bet on a horse scores a certain number of points at the end of the game based on that horse’s final placement, shown below:

1st - 2 points
2nd - 4 points
3rd - 6 points
4th - 8 points
5th - 10 points
6th - 7 points
7th - 5 points
8th - 3 points
9th - 1 point

If two or more horses finish in the same round, the horse that goes the furthest past the finish line finishes first, the horse that goes the second furthest finishes second, etc. Further ties are broken alphabetically based on the horse’s letter, with A finishing first and I finishing last.

Players also score 1 point for each horse in their current space that round. Additionally, players can score points through Round 10’s Utility Ability.

The final scoreboard is revealed at the end of the game.

### **Winning**

The player with the most points after the final round wins two Tokens of Life, and the player with the second most points wins one ToL. If there is a tie for first place, all of those who are tied win one ToL, with no further ToLs being given out. If there is a sole winner and a tie for second place, only two ToLs are given out; the sole winner chooses which of the tied players wins the other ToL. At most four players can tie for first and receive ToLs; if more than four people tie for first, no ToLs are given out.

A garnet is awarded at the end of the Main Match for every 30 points a player has scored.

The player with the fewest points is the Elimination Candidate, with ties broken by a plurality vote among those who **won** a ToL in the Main Match (being given a ToL does not count as winning it). If there is a tie in voting, the player with the most votes and whose voters have the highest total of garnets (after garnet rewards are given out) becomes the EC. If this is still a tie, the EC is randomized among those tied.

### **Garnets**

You can use 2 garnets to purchase a horse card of your choice. Each additional purchase costs twice as much as the previous one.

### **Submissions**

You have 24 hours each round to submit the following actions:

-Which ability you are using, and the relevant details. Incomplete or invalid submissions will result in no ability being used.
-Spectating a space on the track. Blank and invalid submissions will result in no space being spectated. 
-Betting on horses in your current space. Betting more than 5 chips will result in your entire submission being invalidated, while an invalid bet on a horse will result in the bet for that horse being invalidated. 

For Round 0, you have 48 hours to submit, and you only need to submit for the ability.
